## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **`/loop` scheduled tasks now actually fire — full port of Claude Code's
  session-scoped scheduler** (docs/en/scheduled-tasks). A new
  `src/scheduled_tasks` engine parses standard 5-field vixie cron
  expressions (wildcards, steps, ranges, lists, dow 0/7=Sunday, dom/dow OR
  semantics, local timezone) and fires due prompts between turns from the
  agent-server worker's idle poll. `CronCreate`/`CronList`/`CronDelete`
  register real firing jobs (8-char IDs, 50-job cap, deterministic per-job
  jitter, 7-day recurring expiry with a final fire, one-shots self-delete);
  the new `ScheduleWakeup` tool drives self-paced `/loop` mode (delay
  clamped 60–3600 s, `stop: true` ends the loop, one ~20-minute fallback
  wakeup when an iteration forgets to reschedule). Esc while idle clears a
  pending loop wakeup; `/clear` drops all session tasks; `/resume` restores
  unexpired ones; `CLAWCODEX_DISABLE_CRON=1` disables the scheduler.
- **Typed skill slash commands reach the backend:** the TUI's slash
  dispatch falls back from workflow commands to a new `skill_command`
  control that expands bundled/disk skills through the same path the
  model-side Skill tool uses — so `/loop 5m check ci` (and any
  user-invocable skill) now works typed from the composer, with `/loop`
  listed in the completion menu.
- **TUI scheduled-task indicator:** a persistent `⟳ loop wakeup in 2m 14s ·
  ⏰ 1 scheduled` line above the composer (cronStore + CronIndicator), fed
  by new `cron_status` events that also render fire/stop/restore lines in
  the transcript.

### Changed

- **Directory rebrand: clawcodex state now lives under `~/.clawcodex/` and
  `<project>/.clawcodex/` everywhere.** The subsystems that still read/wrote
  the real Claude Code harness's `~/.claude/` and `./.claude/` (user skills,
  agents, workflows, hooks settings, auto-memory, MCP config + OAuth tokens,
  CLAUDE.md/rules enumeration, output styles, plugins, uploads, project
  `config.json`, bridge worktrees + pointer, `--worktree` sessions, tool
  results, startup-perf, `loop.md`, `debug.log`) were repointed to the
  clawcodex-branded locations. Sharing directories with the Claude Code
  harness meant inheriting and mutating another tool's live state.
- Env overrides renamed: `CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` → `CLAWCODEX_CONFIG_DIR`,
  `CLAUDE_MANAGED_CONFIG_DIR` → `CLAWCODEX_MANAGED_CONFIG_DIR`; managed
  defaults unified to `/etc/clawcodex`. The old `CLAUDE_*` variables are
  intentionally ignored (honoring the other harness's override would
  re-couple the two tools' state).
- `--worktree` sessions are created under `.clawcodex/worktrees/`;
  pre-rebrand worktrees under `.claude/worktrees/` are still resumed and
  removable in place (git registers them by absolute path).
- New worktrees no longer receive a copy of the repo's
  `.claude/settings.local.json` (a foreign harness's permission grants);
  only `.clawcodex/settings.local.json` is propagated.

### Added

- One-time startup migration copying legacy `~/.claude` state
  (skills — size-capped per skill, agents, workflows, outputStyles,
  plugins, rules, `CLAUDE.md`, per-project `memory/`) into `~/.clawcodex`.
  Copy-only and destination-absent-only: nothing under `~/.claude` is ever
  modified, and existing `~/.clawcodex` files always win. Marker:
  `~/.clawcodex/.claude-migration.json`.
- `clawcodex migrate [--user-only|--project-only]` — re-attempts the user
  migration and migrates the current project's `.claude/` config dirs into
  `./.clawcodex/` (settings files and worktrees are deliberately skipped).

### Migration notes

- User-scope MCP servers previously stored in `~/.claude/config.json` are
  NOT migrated (that file is shared with the real Claude Code harness and
  clawcodex's entries can't be told apart) — re-add them with
  `clawcodex mcp add --scope user`. MCP OAuth tokens live in the OS
  keychain and are unaffected.
- `settings.json` / `settings.local.json` are never migrated: on a machine
  with both tools they hold the other harness's live permission grants and
  hooks. Copy them manually only if they were written for clawcodex.

### Known Limitations

- Context building is still in early MVP form and needs deeper project summarization
- Permission enforcement exists as a framework but is not fully integrated everywhere
- `/resume`, `/compact`, and `/doctor` are not implemented yet
- The current CLI uses turn-based output even though providers expose streaming interfaces

### Migration Notes

This is the initial MVP release. No migration needed.

### Future Roadmap

- [ ] Context enrichment and project-memory improvements
- [ ] Full permission integration
- [ ] `/resume`, `/compact`, `/doctor`
- [ ] Token usage and cost tracking
- [ ] MCP and plugin-system enhancements

## Release Notes

### v0.1.0 - MVP Release

This is the first public release of ClawCodex, a complete reimplementation of Claude Code. This MVP includes:

- Full multi-provider support
- Interactive REPL
- Session management
- Configuration system
- Tool system and agent loop foundations
- Type-safe implementation

The focus was on building a solid foundation with clean architecture, comprehensive testing, and good developer experience. All core features are working and tested.

**Special Thanks**: This project is inspired by Claude Code and aims to provide an open-source alternative for learning and experimentation.
